# >Model ATM_ESP32< !

This project is based on userinterface using Tkinter with python and a working model of ESP32 using Google workspaces like Spreadsheet's for online Cloud.

## ðŸ›  Languages
Arduino, Python, Google Apps script...


## Libraries
### Arduino

In Arduino ide use ```"WiFi.h"``` for ESP32 to access the Wifi and ```<HTTPClient.h>``` for sending ```http``` requests to internet.

### Python
In Python ide use ```tkinter``` for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) and ```serial``` for accessing the Serial Port and seting BaudRate.

**Install these Libraries using the Following Commands**

```
pip install tkinter

pip install pyserial
```

### Google AppsScript
In AppsScript ```doGet``` function to access the parameters sent by ESP32 and return the desired outputs to ESP32.
